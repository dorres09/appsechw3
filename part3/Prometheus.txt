Part 3

Part 3.1
	Deleted the following as it exposes password in views.py:
		
		if pword not in graphs.keys():
        		graphs[pword] = Counter(f'counter_{pword}', 'The total number of '\
       	 	  + f'times {pword} was used')
       	 graphs[pword].inc()
       	 
Part 3.2
	The following is added under # Prometheus stuff! in line 16 of views.py:
		
		graphs['database_error_return_404'] = Counter('database_error_return_404', 'The Total number'\
		  + ' of 404 messages.')
		  
	Also, graphs['database_error_return_404'].inc() is added above every line that has return HttpResponse("Error 404: Internal Server Error")
	
Part 3.3
	I was not able to complete part 3.3 as my VM crashed and erased all my work just few hours before the deadline.
